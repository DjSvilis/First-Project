      <h2>Requirements.</h2>
      <p>
        In order to be eligible to get your mythic weapon, you must meet ALL of
        these requirements:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          You must have completed Twine Peak Storm Shield Defense 5. If you need
          help with your Storm Shield Defense (SSD), check out my SSD carry
          listing.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must have the Storm King Quest in your Quests Log (For the first
          time, it appears as King Me Quest), and if it's not your first time,
          it will appear in Weekly Challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must have completed your Prequest (the quests are in 140+ zones).
          If you haven't completed your Prequest, purchase the bundle
          Prequest+MSK (it shows as MPN in the listing)
        </li>
        <p>
          If all 3 above are done, you must make sure again you have the Quest
          that says: Eliminate/Defeat The Mythic Storm King (Be careful! It
          resets every week).
        </p>
      </ol>
